          Is Netflix good for kids?

            <p>
              The Netflix Kids experience is included in your membership to give

              films in their own space. Kids profiles come with PIN-protected
              parental controls that let you restrict the maturity rating of
              content kids can watch and block specific titles you don’t want
              kids to see.
